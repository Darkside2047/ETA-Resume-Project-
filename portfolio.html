                and blossoming into a business venture. The ETA acronym is an an acronym that is meant to motivate and encourage. With 
                E representing enmpowerment, T representing triumph, and A representing Ascension. Look deep within and find your greatness...
                Its is your time... your power... Step into it!</p>

                      </video>I enjoy making small media presentations when working on projects 
                    either for class presentations or for my personal ETA business venture. I also have a collection
                    of other media projects that I have to use for future business ventures.</p>

                   <p><img src="images/Collection.jpg" alt="The ETA main logo">This is a small sample of an exclusive
                      gold vinyl print edition that will be featured for my upcoming business venture. I also have 
                      a small collection from ETA hoodies for the winter, and T shirts for the warmer seasons. As time
                      progresses, I am looking forward to creating new designs along with more additions to the media projects. </p>

                        One of the most challenging courses I have taken was web115 which centered around introducing javascript. Though I have a background
                        in coding, this course was especialy challenging do the the nature of having to learn the different structure and syntax of javascript
                        and how its incorporated into the webpage. Feel free to click the links below to explore some of my previous course work.</p>
